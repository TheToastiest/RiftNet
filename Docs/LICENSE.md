**Effective Date**: July 12, 2025

You can use this software — **freely** — in personal, academic, commercial, or experimental projects, under the following terms:

---

## ✅ You CAN:

- Use RiftNet in any project, for any purpose.
- Modify, adapt, and build upon it however you want.
- Distribute it with your own projects (binary or source).
- Learn from it. Fork it. Expand it.
- Share it with others — just keep this license intact.

---

## ❌ You CANNOT:

- Hold the author liable for anything that breaks, explodes, or desyncs.
- Claim you wrote RiftNet if you didn’t.

## 💬 Plain English Warranty Disclaimer

This code is provided **"as-is"**, with **no warranty**, **no guarantee**, and **no support contract**.

If it works, great. If it doesn’t, fix it.  
If it breaks something in your game, system, or reality, that’s on you — not the author.

## 🔑 License Identity

This license is a **philosophical fork** of MIT, shaped around the RiftForged design doctrine:
> “Truth isn’t proprietary. But it isn’t customer service either.”

RiftNet is shared in the open for the good of developers and the evolution of real-time systems.  
There is **no support**, **no gatekeeping**, and **no charge** — but also **no guarantees**.

Use it with clarity. Respect the work. Build something worthy.
