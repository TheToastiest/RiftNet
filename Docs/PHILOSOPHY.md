> **1. Sync is not interpolation â€” it is truth moved across time.**  
> The server is the law. All clients reflect its state, not guess at it.

---

> **2. Do not optimize past clarity without understanding the architecture.**  
> Clarity is performance. Confusion is the slowest bottleneck of all.

---

> **3. Read before you write.**  
> Understand the system. Follow the current. Code that defies intent is tech debt in disguise.

---

> **4. Throwing code at the wall is futility.**  
> If you donâ€™t know why it works, it doesnâ€™t. Temporary hacks cost more than permanent truth.

---

> **5. Simulation is sacred.**  
> Fake physics break immersion. Fake logic breaks systems. We donâ€™t fake.

---

> **6. Versioning marks evolution, not decoration.**  
> Every version number reflects a change in communication or assumption. Treat it as such.

---

> **7. Sync logic, serialization formats, and protocol behavior must be aligned.**  
> The packet is the contract. The engine is the executor. Donâ€™t sever the chain.

---

> **8. We build to endure, not to impress.**  
> There is no shame in rebuilding â€” only in forgetting why it mattered in the first place.

## ðŸ”’ Notes

This doctrine defines the technical and philosophical principles that guide RiftForged and its modular systems (e.g. RiftNet, RiftSerializer, RiftPhys, etc.).  
If you're reading this â€” **understand before contributing**. This is not just code. It is architecture with memory and consequence.
